Using Beach.java in Jython
::
    
    >>> import Beach
    >>> beach = Beach("Cocoa Beach","Cocoa Beach")
    >>> beach.getName()
    u'Cocoa Beach'
    >>> print beach.getName()
    Cocoa Beach


As we had learned in Chapter 8, one thing you'll need to do is ensure that the Java class you wish to use resides within your CLASSPATH. In the example above, I created a JAR file that contained the Beach class and then put that JAR on the CLASSPATH.

It is also possible to extend or subclass Java classes via Jython classes.
This allows us to extend the functionality of a given Java class using Jython objects, which can be quite helpful at times.
The next example shows a Jython class extending a Java class that includes some calculation functionality.
The Jython class then adds another calculation method and makes use of the calculation methods from both the Java class and the Jython class.
